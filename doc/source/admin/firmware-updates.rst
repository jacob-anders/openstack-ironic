Firmware Updates
================

The firmware update step applies one or more images via cleaning, servicing or
deployment, in the order supplied by the operator. By default, each non-BMC
component has its own host reboot. Operators can opt into grouping adjacent
non-BMC components into one reboot, as described below. BMC updates have their
own recovery phase.

Failures after an update starts stop the sequence and place the node in
maintenance, preserving host power and boot configuration. Images already
staged on the BMC may remain scheduled for the next boot. Inspect the BMC jobs
before recovery or retrying the step.

.. note:: Only :doc:`/admin/drivers/redfish` supports firmware updates
   currently.

When updating the BMC firmware, the BMC may become unavailable for a period of
time as it resets. In this case, it may be desirable to have the step
wait after the update has been applied before indicating that the
update was successful. This allows the BMC time to fully reset before further
operations are carried out against it. To cause the step to wait after
applying an update, an optional ``wait`` argument may be specified in the
firmware image dictionary. The value of this argument indicates the number of
seconds for the component's wait. For BMC updates it controls the version-check
timeout. For non-BMC updates it is a minimum settling interval after application
and host recovery. A grouped segment uses the largest requested ``wait`` or
:oslo.config:option:`redfish.firmware_update_inventory_wait`, whichever is
greater. These waits never replace application or reboot verification.

Grouping host reboots
---------------------

Set the boolean ``allow_grouping_reboots`` in the step's ``args`` to ``true`` to
stage adjacent non-BMC images and apply them with one consolidated host reboot.
Its default is ``false``. Supported component names remain ``bmc``, ``bios`` and
``nic:<Id>``; grouping does not enable other component names.

The recommended order is BMC first, followed by BIOS and NICs. Ironic neither
reorders the list nor rejects a sub-optimal order solely because of its order.
Each BMC entry ends the preceding non-BMC segment. For example,
``[bios, nic:1, bmc, nic:2]`` has two separate non-BMC reboot segments. Duplicate
components in the same non-BMC segment are rejected; repeats across a BMC
boundary or in ungrouped updates are allowed.

BMC recovery remains separate and can require its existing host handoff reboot
when more components follow. The single-reboot guarantee applies to each
non-BMC segment, not necessarily to the entire mixed BMC/non-BMC request.

.. code-block:: json

   [{
     "interface": "firmware",
     "step": "update",
     "args": {
       "allow_grouping_reboots": true,
       "settings": [
         {"component": "bmc", "url": "https://example.com/bmc.bin"},
         {"component": "bios", "url": "https://example.com/bios.exe"},
         {"component": "nic:NIC.Integrated.1-1-1",
          "url": "https://example.com/nic.zip"}
       ]
     }
   }]

Grouped ``SimpleUpdate`` requests explicitly request ``OnReset`` through the
standard ``@Redfish.OperationApplyTime`` action annotation. A rejected request
fails the step rather than being retried without deferred application. On Dell,
Ironic waits for an armed Lifecycle Controller job before staging another image;
on HPE and other platforms it waits for staging task completion. A generic
``Starting`` task alone does not authorize submitting another grouped image.

NIC staging prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some platforms, notably HPE, expose ``NetworkAdapters`` only while an OS is
running. Ironic waits for this visibility before staging any image in an HPE
segment containing NIC updates. For day-0 workflows, boot IPA first, for example
using fast-track after inspection. For servicing, keep the deployed OS running
until the firmware step requests its reboot. Disabling the ramdisk does not
remove this hardware prerequisite, and Ironic does not boot a tenant OS merely
to satisfy it.

Verification and timeouts
-------------------------

A terminal Redfish task may describe downloading and staging rather than
application. Each segment retains its state until the available application,
boot and inventory checks finish. Dell checks include every tracked firmware
job and additional jobs discovered during POST. Failed jobs fail the step;
missing jobs and unknown states do not establish success. Older supported sushy
versions receive the same full job-state checks through a compatibility reader.

Reboot observation compares reset timestamps and boot-progress transitions with
the pre-reboot snapshot. A read failure is not proof of a reset. Servicing waits
for ``OSRunning`` where reported. Cleaning and deploy also accept hardware
initialization completion or setup, so a tenant OS boot is not required. BMC
version checking and resource-stability validation run in their own phases.

The following ``[redfish]`` settings control asynchronous waits:

* :oslo.config:option:`redfish.firmware_update_apply_timeout`: 1800 seconds for a
  segment, including preparation, staging, application and inventory recovery.
  Increase this for large or slow batches. It remains enabled when the overall
  timeout is disabled.
* :oslo.config:option:`redfish.firmware_update_post_reboot_verify_timeout`:
  1800 seconds after an apply reboot. Setting it to zero disables this narrower
  deadline, while the segment deadline remains enforced.
* :oslo.config:option:`redfish.firmware_update_reboot_min_wait`: 60 seconds before
  accepting host readiness. This minimum does not replace new-boot evidence.
* :oslo.config:option:`redfish.firmware_update_boot_check_delay`: 600 seconds for
  missing or explicitly limited boot telemetry. Budget for the entire batch's
  POST and flashing duration, not just an ordinary boot, and keep the delay
  within the segment deadline.
* :oslo.config:option:`redfish.firmware_update_os_running_timeout`: 300 seconds
  after observing the new boot finish POST during servicing. Expiry fails the
  step. Zero uses the broader deadlines rather than skipping readiness.
* :oslo.config:option:`redfish.firmware_update_inventory_wait`: 60 seconds after
  application and recovery to allow inventory publication to catch up.
* :oslo.config:option:`redfish.firmware_update_tasks_per_poll`: at most 16 task
  monitors sampled per invocation, spreading large batches across polls.

Sampling follows :oslo.config:option:`redfish.firmware_update_status_interval`.
Resource-validation intervals are minimum intervals between periodic samples;
they do not sleep inside a conductor worker. The old blocking
``firmware_update_reboot_watch_timeout`` is deprecated and ignored by the
firmware state machine.

For a platform known to report only intermediate boot stages, explicitly set
``driver_info/firmware_update_boot_progress=limited``. The default, ``auto``,
requires reported readiness and uses the fallback delay only when boot progress
is absent. A stalled supported check is never automatically classified as
unsupported. Neither policy bypasses supported job or reset checks. A fallback
delay cannot prove OS health.

Firmware packages are vendor-specific. Ironic does not infer expected versions
from filenames or image contents, and no expected-version input is required.
It verifies available task/job outcomes and recovery, then refreshes inventory;
this is not an exact comparison against an image's intended version.
Same-version reinstalls are valid.

State and failure recovery
--------------------------

The versioned ``driver_internal_info/redfish_fw_update`` object records the
current phase, timestamps, remaining settings and per-segment observations.
Normal host updates follow:

.. code-block:: text

   starting -> staging -> rebooting -> applying -> verifying_apply
       -> verifying_boot -> verifying_inventory -> next segment or completion

BMC segments use ``waiting_bmc`` and ``validating_bmc`` before inventory
verification or their required host reboot. Submission and reboot intent are
persisted before the request, so an ambiguous response is not automatically
replayed. Legacy queues and unsupported state-schema versions require recovery
rather than silently skipping unapplied components.

If staging fails after another image has been staged, Ironic fails the whole
step without a consolidated reboot. Read ``last_error`` and node history,
inspect pending BMC Tasks/Jobs and remove queued images if appropriate before
aborting servicing and retrying. Timeout does not mean flashing has stopped:
do not power-cycle a node that may still be applying firmware. Failure handling
preserves power even when cleaning or servicing failure power-off options are
enabled.

How it works
------------

The ``update`` step can be used via cleaning, servicing or deployment. It accepts
JSON in
the following format::

    [{
        "interface": "firmware",
        "step": "update",
        "args": {
            "settings":[
                {
                    "component": "bmc",
                    "url": "<url_to_firmware_image1>",
                    "wait": <number_of_seconds_to_wait>
                },
                {
                    "component": "bios",
                    "url": "<url_to_firmware_image2>"
                },
                {
                    "component": "nic:AD0700",
                    "url": "<url_to_firmware_image3>"
                },
                {
                    "component": "nic:NIC.Slot.2",
                    "url": "<url_to_firmware_image4>"
                }
                ...
            ]
        }
    }]

The different attributes of the ``update`` step are as follows:

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Attribute", "Description"
    :widths: 30, 120

    "``interface``", "Interface of the step.  Must be ``firmware`` for firmware update"
    "``step``", "Name of the step.  Must be ``update`` for firmware update"
    "``args``", "Keyword-argument entry (<name>: <value>) being passed to the step"
    "``args.settings``", "Ordered list of dictionaries of firmware updates to be applied"

Each firmware image dictionary is of the form::

    {
      "component": "The desired component to have the firmware updated, supported components are listed below",
      "url": "<URL of firmware image file>",
      "wait": <Optional time in seconds to wait after applying update>
    }

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Supported Components", "Description"
    :widths: 30, 120

    "bmc", "The BMC firmware"
    "bios", "The BIOS firmware"
    "nic:<NIC_REDFISH_ID>", "Since machines can have multiple NICs, we use **nic:** as prefix plus the **NIC_REDFISH_ID** to identify the NIC to update"

The ``component`` and ``url`` arguments in the firmware image dictionary are
mandatory, while the ``wait`` argument is optional.

For ``url`` currently ``http``, ``https``, ``swift`` and ``file`` schemes are
supported.

Applying updates
----------------

To perform a firmware update, first download the firmware to a web server,
Swift or filesystem that the Ironic conductor or BMC has network access to.
This could be the ironic conductor web server or another web server on the BMC
network. Using a web browser, curl, or similar tool on a server that has
network access to the BMC or Ironic conductor, try downloading the firmware to
verify that the URLs are correct and that the web server is configured
properly.

Next, construct the JSON for the firmware update step to be executed.
When launching the firmware update, the JSON may be specified on the command
line directly or in a file. The following example shows one step that
installs two firmware updates.

.. code-block:: json

    [{
        "interface": "firmware",
        "step": "update",
        "args": {
            "settings":[
                {
                    "component": "bmc",
                    "url": "http://192.0.2.10/BMC_4_22_00_00.EXE",
                    "wait": 300
                },
                {
                    "component": "bios",
                    "url": "https://192.0.2.10/BIOS_19.0.12_A00.EXE"
                },
                {
                    "component": "nic:AD0700",
                    "url": "http://192.0.2.10/NIC_19.0.12_AD0700.EXE"
                },
                {
                    "component": "nic:NIC.Slot.2",
                    "url": "http://192.0.2.10/NICSlot2_1.0.12.EXE"
                }
            ]
        }
    }]


It is also possible to use ``runbooks`` for firmware updates.

First, create a YAML file with the firmware update steps. For example, save the
following as ``firmware_runbook.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - interface: firmware
      step: update
      args:
        settings:
          - component: bmc
            url: http://192.168.0.8:8080/ilo5278.bin
          - component: nic:AD0700
            url: http://192.168.0.8:8080/nic.bin
          - component: nic:NIC.Slot.2
            url: http://192.168.0.8:8080/nic.bin

Then create and use the runbook:

.. code-block:: console

    $ baremetal runbook create --name <RUNBOOK> --steps firmware_runbook.yaml
    $ baremetal node add trait <ironic_node_uuid> <RUNBOOK>
    $ baremetal node <clean or service>  <ironic_node_uuid> --runbook <RUNBOOK>

Finally, launch the firmware update step against the node. The
following example assumes the above JSON is in a file named
``update.json``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ baremetal node clean <ironic_node_uuid> --clean-steps update.json
   $ baremetal node service <ironic_node_uuid> --service-steps update.json

.. note::
   You can use the ``--disable-ramdisk`` flag to perform firmware updates
   without booting into the ramdisk, which saves reboots and speeds up the
   process:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ baremetal node clean <ironic_node_uuid> --disable-ramdisk --clean-steps update.json
      $ baremetal node service <ironic_node_uuid> --disable-ramdisk --service-steps update.json

In the following example, the JSON is specified directly on the command line:

.. code-block:: console

   $ baremetal node clean <ironic_node_uuid> --clean-steps \
       '[{"interface": "firmware", "step": "update", "args": {"settings":[{"component": "bmc", "url":"http://192.168.0.8:8080/ilo5278.bin"}]}}]'
   $ baremetal node clean <ironic_node_uuid> --clean-steps \
       '[{"interface": "firmware", "step": "update", "args": {"settings":[{"component": "bios", "url":"http://192.168.0.8:8080/bios.bin"}]}}]'
   $ baremetal node service <ironic_node_uuid> --service-steps \
       '[{"interface": "firmware", "step": "update", "args": {"settings":[{"component": "bmc", "url":"http://192.168.0.8:8080/ilo5278.bin"}]}}]'
   $ baremetal node service <ironic_node_uuid> --service-steps \
       '[{"interface": "firmware", "step": "update", "args": {"settings":[{"component": "bios", "url":"http://192.168.0.8:8080/bios.bin"}]}}]'
   $ baremetal node clean <ironic_node_uuid> --clean-steps \
       '[{"interface": "firmware", "step": "update", "args": {"settings":[{"component": "nic:AD0700", "url":"http://192.168.0.8:8080/nic.bin"}]}}]'
   $ baremetal node clean <ironic_node_uuid> --clean-steps \
       '[{"interface": "firmware", "step": "update", "args": {"settings":[{"component": "nic:NIC.Slot.2", "url":"http://192.168.0.8:8080/nic.bin"}]}}]'

.. note::
   For Dell machines, you must extract the firmimgFIT.d9 from the iDRAC.exe
   This can be done using the command ``7za e iDRAC_<VERSION>.exe``.

.. note::
   For HPE machines you must extract the ilo5_<version>.bin from the
   ilo5_<version>.fwpkg
   This can be done using the command ``7za e ilo<version>.fwpkg``.

How it works - via Management Interface
---------------------------------------

.. deprecated::
   The management interface for firmware updates is deprecated in favor of
   the firmware interface. Please use the firmware interface for new
   deployments.

The ``update_firmware`` cleaning step accepts JSON in the following format::

    [{
        "interface": "management",
        "step": "update_firmware",
        "args": {
            "firmware_images":[
                {
                    "url": "<url_to_firmware_image1>",
                    "checksum": "<checksum for image, uses SHA1, SHA256, or SHA512>",
                    "source": "<optional override source setting for image>",
                    "wait": <number_of_seconds_to_wait>
                },
                {
                    "url": "<url_to_firmware_image2>"
                },
                ...
            ]
        }
    }]

The different attributes of the ``update_firmware`` cleaning step are as follows:

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Attribute", "Description"
    :widths: 30, 120

    "``interface``", "Interface of the cleaning step.  Must be ``management`` for firmware update"
    "``step``", "Name of cleaning step.  Must be ``update_firmware`` for firmware update"
    "``args``", "Keyword-argument entry (<name>: <value>) being passed to the step"
    "``args.firmware_images``", "Ordered list of dictionaries of firmware images to be applied"

Each firmware image dictionary is of the form::

    {
      "url": "<URL of firmware image file>",
      "checksum": "<checksum for image, uses SHA1>",
      "source": "<Optional override source setting for image>",
      "wait": <Optional time in seconds to wait after applying update>
    }

The ``url`` and ``checksum`` arguments in the firmware image dictionary are
mandatory, while the ``source`` and ``wait`` arguments are optional.

For ``url`` currently ``http``, ``https``, ``swift`` and ``file`` schemes are
supported.

``source`` corresponds to :oslo.config:option:`redfish.firmware_source` and by
setting it here, it is possible to override global setting per firmware image
in clean step arguments.

.. note::
   At the present time, targets for the firmware update cannot be specified.
   In testing, the BMC applied the update to all applicable targets on the
   node. It is assumed that the BMC knows what components a given firmware
   image is applicable to.

To perform a firmware update, first download the firmware to a web server,
Swift or filesystem that the Ironic conductor or BMC has network access to.
This could be the ironic conductor web server or another web server on the BMC
network. Using a web browser, curl, or similar tool on a server that has
network access to the BMC or Ironic conductor, try downloading the firmware to
verify that the URLs are correct and that the web server is configured
properly.

Next, construct the JSON for the firmware update cleaning step to be executed.
When launching the firmware update, the JSON may be specified on the command
line directly or in a file. The following example shows one cleaning step that
installs four firmware updates. All except 3rd entry that has explicit
``source`` added, uses the setting from :oslo.config:option:`redfish.firmware_source`
to determine if and where to stage the files:

.. code-block:: json

    [{
        "interface": "management",
        "step": "update_firmware",
        "args": {
            "firmware_images":[
                {
                    "url": "http://192.0.2.10/BMC_4_22_00_00.EXE",
                    "checksum": "<sha1-checksum-of-the-file>",
                    "wait": 300
                },
                {
                    "url": "https://192.0.2.10/NIC_19.0.12_A00.EXE",
                    "checksum": "<sha1-checksum-of-the-file>"
                },
                {
                    "url": "file:///firmware_images/idrac/9/PERC_WN64_6.65.65.65_A00.EXE",
                    "checksum": "<sha1-checksum-of-the-file>",
                    "source": "http"
                },
                {
                    "url": "swift://firmware_container/BIOS_W8Y0W_WN64_2.1.7.EXE",
                    "checksum": "<sha1-checksum-of-the-file>"
                }
            ]
        }
    }]

Finally, launch the firmware update cleaning step against the node. The
following example assumes the above JSON is in a file named
``firmware_update.json``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ baremetal node clean <ironic_node_uuid> --clean-steps firmware_update.json

In the following example, the JSON is specified directly on the command line:

.. code-block:: console

   $ baremetal node clean <ironic_node_uuid> --clean-steps \
       '[{"interface": "management", "step": "update_firmware", "args": {"firmware_images":[{"url": "http://192.0.2.10/BMC_4_22_00_00.EXE", "wait": 300}, {"url": "https://192.0.2.10/NIC_19.0.12_A00.EXE"}]}}]'

.. note::
   Firmware updates may take some time to complete. If a firmware update
   cleaning step consistently times out, then consider performing fewer
   firmware updates in the cleaning step or increasing
   ``clean_callback_timeout`` in ironic.conf to increase the timeout value.

.. warning::
   Warning: Removing power from a server while it is in the process of updating
   firmware may result in devices in the server, or the server itself becoming
   inoperable.
